### sample maths explanation

The above equation represents a conditional probability distribution function, specifically a Gaussian distribution. It is used in the context of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Kalman filters.

In this context, x_t and x_t-1 represent the state variables at time t and t-1, respectively. The function p(x_t-1 | x_t) represents the probability of being in state x_t-1 at time t-1, given that the system is in state x_t at time t.

The Gaussian distribution is defined by its mean μ_θ(x_t, t) and covariance matrix Σ_θ(x_t, t), which are functions of the state x_t at time t and the model parameters θ.

The equation states that the conditional probability of being in state x_t-1 at time t-1, given the state x_t at time t, follows a Gaussian distribution with mean μ_θ(x_t, t) and covariance matrix Σ_θ(x_t, t).

This equation is used to model the transition between states in Hidden Markov Models and Kalman filters, where the state variables follow a Gaussian distribution.
