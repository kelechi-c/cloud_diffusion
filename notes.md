##### my own **text2image latent diffusion model** (**Stable Diffusion**) from scratch. Implemented from the paper.

I implemented this paper, not because I have some underground GPU cluster, but simply because diffusion(and image generation) interests me generally.
And also because diffusion kept interefering in many other things I wanted to build/train, both for audio and images
So I decided to build it and understand it better.

Well I started in the beginning of September(trained a tiny diffusion net in July though), but my *revelation curse* struck again and I dropped it for Diffusion Transformers.
But I after going father I realized I was lacking some ground knowledge on diffusion models, and here I am....again.

So I will have some by-product models[VAE, U-Net, the diffusion network], which, hopefully I can adapt for many other stuff I want to build[esp for audio]
